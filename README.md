## General Information
- I have ONEPIECE character database, because I made it about thee years ago. However, It is difficult for people to see and understand table data. So I thought it is a good chance to visually show data I gathered and neatned before.
- In terms of technology, I'm now interested in frontend development. I did not want to develop only frontend, but also backend, evenif it is simplified, and connect them by using API.
